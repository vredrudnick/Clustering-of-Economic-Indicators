# Clustering-of-Economic-Indicators
Notes on the code in .ipynb (by cells):
- IMPORTANT: do not execute Cell 1.4 unless 1.3 fails. In this case, use .csv.
- Cell 1.1: the code was written for working in a Google Colab (Jupyter notebook) environment. Modify for other environments, i.e. "pip install wbdata".
- Cell 1.3: downloads data from the World Bank Development Indicators database. Not always reliable, alternatively run 1.4 with local .csv file.
- Cell 1.4: choose the .csv file for the year you want, i.e. INSERT.csv for the year 2023.
